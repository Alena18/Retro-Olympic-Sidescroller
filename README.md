### Resources consulted

- Simple sidescroller games were researched as they had well resourced tutorials and were easy to implement

#### KaBoom.js Resources

- [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) Provided the library of functions for the game
- [Kaboom Playground](https://kaboomjs.com/play?example=add) Kaboom had a library of code playgrounds that were particularly useful for quick testing of the framework functions
